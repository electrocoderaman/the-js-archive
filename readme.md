# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository documents my progression through JavaScript, from fundamental concepts to advanced topics like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Asynchronous JavaScript. It contains practical code examples, notes, and mini-projects.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized into three main levels of complexity:

### 1. Basics
Foundational concepts and syntax.
* **Arrays & Strings**: Basic manipulation, methods, and template literals (`basics/array`, `basics/string`).
* **Loops**: Exploration of various loop types including `for`, `for...of`, `for...in`, and array methods like `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` (`basics/loop`).
* **Functions**: Understanding scopes, arrow functions, IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions), and the `this` keyword (`basics/function`).

### 2. Intermediate
Working with the browser environment.
* **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting elements, creating/removing nodes, and understanding the parent-child relationship (`Intermediate/DOM`).
* **Events**: Handling click events, propagation, and timing events like `setTimeout` and `setInterval` (`Intermediate/Events`).

### 3. Advanced
Deep dive into modern JS features and architecture.
* **Classes & OOP**: Constructors, Inheritance (`extends`), Static properties, and Polymorphism (`Advance/Classes and OOP'S`).
* **Prototypes**: Understanding JavaScript's prototypal behavior, `call`, and `bind`.
* **Getters & Setters**: using `get` and `set` in both classes and objects (`Advance/getter_setter.js`, `properties_get_set.js`).
* **Async JavaScript**: Handling API requests (`XMLHttpRequest`, `fetch`), Promises, and Async/Await (`Advance/API`).

### 4. Extras
* **Closures**: Practical examples of lexical scoping (`Extra's/closure.html`).

## 🚀 Highlights

* **Shopping Cart Logic**: Using `reduce` to calculate totals.
* **GitHub User Card**: A mini-project fetching user data from the GitHub API and displaying it on a card.
* **Custom Prototypes**: Injecting custom methods into standard objects like `Array` and `String`.

## 📝 Notes
* Detailed notes on OOP pillars (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism) can be found in `Advance/Classes and OOP'S/notes.md`.
